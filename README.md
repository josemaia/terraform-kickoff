# Getting started with this guide

This is a tutorial repository to get started with a basic Terraform learning setup on Azure

## What do I need?

- az cli installed (<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli>)
- Valid Azure subscription ([Free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free) should be fine) in which you have high permissions. Az cli needs to be logged in to this subscription and tenant.
- Terraform installed (recommend version 1.5.x because of the licensing. You can easily install with tools such as [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-hashicorp))

## How do I follow this tutorial along?

This was designed to be done in a small group (10-20), with someone leading the group in the exercises, then each member following along in their laptop. You can write the Terraform code yourself for each of the examples, or go to the subfolders for each step.
